# AI Coach App
## Overview


The Bicep Curl Counter project utilizes Mediapipe's Pose Estimation Model Blazepose to accurately detect and track key landmarks of the human body in a video.
Specifically, the 3D coordinates of the wrist, elbow, and shoulder keypoints are extracted to monitor the movement of the arms during bicep curls.

## Demo
The Following GIF shows how the project works:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Usage

### Running with webcam

```bash
python app.py 
```

### Running without analysis

```bash
python app.py dataset/Bicep.mp4
```

### Running with analysis

```bash
python app.py dataset/Bicep.mp4 <correct_left_count> <correct_right_count> <incorrect_left_count> <incorrect_right_count>
```





## Features

- Real-time visualization of bicep curls count and correctness analysis.
- Supports both left and right bicep curl counts.
- Tracks angles of shoulder, elbow, and wrist for accurate counting.
